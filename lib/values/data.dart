Our organization focuses on fostering a community of like minded individuals who are seeking to find ways to stop participating in modern unsustainable consumerism. We host meetings discussing sustainability and the harmful effects of the fashion industry as well as providing sessions for needlework to teach members how to crochet/knit/sew their own clothing. This provides an open community that upholds each other and shares personal ideas to educate and encourage each member.
